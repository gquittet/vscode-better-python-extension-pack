# Better Python Extension Pack

VSCode has a great support for Python. But it can be better.  
To fix this, I made this extension pack that add Python powers to VSCode.

## List of extensions built-in

- littlefoxteam.vscode-python-test-adapter
- ms-python.python
- ms-python.vscode-pylance
- ms-toolsai.jupyter

**Enjoy!**
